	about: "Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI; Taubman – Ben&#8209;Ari, Gillath, & Mikulincer, 2004) was constructed on three underling principles: the complex and multidimensional nature of the phenomenon of driving is best reflected through driving styles; existing definitions and scales of driving styles need to be integrated into a single, multidimensional conceptualization; and whereas most earlier research related to driving behaviors associated with crashes, it is important to broaden the scope to include characteristics of driving in general in order to understand the whole range of variables that predict how people drive, including safe, careful, and, considerate behaviors.\nThis approach led to the design of a 44-item scale assessing four differentiated driving styles (1) Reckless and careless; (2) Anxious; (3) Angry and hostile; and (4) Patient and careful.\nThe Reckless and careless style (11 items) refers to deliberate violations of safe driving norms and the seeking of sensations and thrills while driving. It is the most salient reflection of risky driving behavior, characterized by driving at high speeds, passing in no-passing lanes, and driving while intoxicated. The Anxious style (19 items) relates to feelings of vigilance, nervousness, and tension, as well as ineffective engagement in relaxing activities during driving. This style characterizes people who feel unsure of themselves as drivers, and reflects their sense of helplessness and insecurity. The Angry and hostile style (5 items) refers to expressions of irritation, rage, and hostility on the road, such as cursing other drivers, honking the horn, or flashing headlights. It indicates aggression accompanied by a motivation to beat out other vehicles in competitive traffic situations. The Patient and careful style (9 items) relates to well-adjusted driving behaviors, such as planning ahead, paying full attention to the road, displaying patience, courtesy, and calm behind the wheel, and obeying the traffic rules. It characterizes drivers who are considerate and sympathetic to other drivers’ needs, and who exhibit understanding of complex traffic situations.\nDrivers respond to a series of statements about their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors while driving, indicating the degree to which each applies to them on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very much). The responses to the items on each subscale are averaged to produce four driving style scores, with higher scores indicating a higher level of the particular style",
