	about: "Personal Commitment to Safe Driving Scale (PCSDS; Taubman – Ben-Ari & Katz – Ben-Ami, 2012) is a 5-item instrument tapping drivers' sense of responsibility on the road and commitment to safe and careful driving. Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which each of the statements describes their behavior as a driver on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The responses to all 5 items are averaged to produce a total score, with higher scores reflecting a higher commitment to safe driving.",
