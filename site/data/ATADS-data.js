	about: "Attitudes toward Accompanied Driving Scale (ATADS; Taubman – Ben-Ari, 2010) is a 23-item instrument tapping attitudes toward accompanied driving. Two versions are available, one for young drivers and one for parents. The two versions are identical save for changes in phrasing to suit the different populations. The scale relates to five factors: (1) Tension (10 items), or the tendency to perceive the experience of accompanied driving as distressing, conflictual, and characterized by stress, tension and anger; (2) Relatedness (2 items), that is, the perception of accompanied driving as an opportunity to get closer to the accompanying driver/young driver and to better relate to them; (3) Avoidance (3 items), i.e., the preference to avoid accompanied driving and to spend as little time as possible in the situation; (4) Disapproval (4 items), or the tendency to receive and express criticism and disapproval during accompanied driving; and (5) Anxiety (4 items), that is, the tendency to be anxious while driving with the accompanying driver/young driver, or to be afraid of being involved in a car crash or making mistakes because of their presence in the car. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which the statement in each item describes their feelings, thoughts, and behavior during the accompanied driving period. Responses are marked on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Scores for each of the five factors are computed by averaging the relevant items, with higher scores reflecting a higher endorsement of the given attitude.",
