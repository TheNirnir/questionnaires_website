	about: "Driving Costs and Benefits Questionnaire (DCBQ; Taubman - Ben-Ari, 2008) aims to tap the subjective perceptions of the costs and benefits of driving as a reflection of the motivations behind driving behavior. The questionnaire consists of two 21-item scales, one assessing benefits and the other costs, and each relating to four factors. The factors in the Benefits subscale include: Impression management (7 items), i.e., the tendency to view driving as an opportunity to express ability and self-worth, and to make efforts to impress others; Pleasure (5 items), or the tendency to feel enjoyment and freedom and to be able to relieve tension and grow calm when driving; Thrill (5 items), that is, the tendency to regard driving as a chance for stimulation, sensation, risk seeking, and daring; and Sense of Control (4 items), or the tendency to feel competent when driving and to sense that one has control over the situation and the vehicle itself). The factors in the Costs subscale include: Distress (7 items), that is, the tendency to feel stress, anxiety, discomfort, and loss of control when driving; Damage to Self-Esteem (7 items), or the tendency to feel that driving harms one's self-esteem, brings out the negative aspects of one's personality, and damages personal relationships); Annoyance (4 items), i.e., the tendency to feel a sense of burden or fatigue when driving; and Life Endangerment (3 items), that is, the tendency to perceive driving as a risk to one's own life or the lives of others. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which each item reflects their feelings and attitudes toward driving, using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Eight scores are calculated by averaging the responses to the relevant items on each factor.",
